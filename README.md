# Loopstudios landing page

In this challenge, I've create a simple HTML/CSS webstylle following some image provided for the design
The site is fully responsive, using only HTML and CSS, only a bit of Javascrit to toggle menu on smaller devices

[It's on github Pages, try it !](https://mowee59.github.io/Loopstudio/)
